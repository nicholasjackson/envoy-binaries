# Envoy Binaries

This repository contains AMD64 and ARM64 versions of [Envoy proxy](https://www.envoyproxy.io/), extracted from the official Docker containers. You can use these binaries when needing to instal Envoy on a non containerised platform until the Envoy project provides official packages. https://github.com/envoyproxy/envoy/issues/16867
